If only I could express how u fill my life with pure happiness nd just your existence makes so much sense to me. it's my first time doing this to someone but you are so worht it and you are more than enough. you make my heart smile and i'm so ready for our future together. they say " if you fall in love with their soul before you touch their skin, it's true love " i couldn't wait any longer to make u mine .<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">Will you be my girlfriend? </p>
